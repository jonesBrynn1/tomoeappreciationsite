    <p>These are the main characters that I use.</p>

    <h2> Langrisser </h2>
    <p>This is a game that I started on back in Spring 2019, and dropped it
      because farming made me demotivated. Then I redownloaded it because I
      remembered how hot Elwin is.</p>

      <p>This is my general profile though.</p>

    <h2> OSU! </h2>
    <p>I have been playing this game since September 2015, but didn't take it
    seriously until quarantine. This is the profile of my progress!</p>
